  **Design Movement**: Neumorphism (Soft UI)
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Tactile Realism**: Elements should look like they are extruded from the background, creating a soft, physical feel.
  2.  **Minimalist Color Palette**: Use a monochromatic base with subtle variations in shadow and highlight to define shapes.
  3.  **Soft Shapes**: Heavy use of rounded corners and smooth transitions to mimic plastic or ceramic surfaces.
  4.  **Focus on Content**: The interface should recede, allowing the typography of the quotes to take center stage.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Base**: Off-white or very light gray (`#e0e5ec`) to serve as the canvas.
  -   **Shadows**: A combination of light (`#ffffff`) and dark (`#a3b1c6`) shadows to create the extruded effect.
  -   **Accent**: A soft, desaturated blue or purple for interactive elements, evoking a sense of calm and intellect.
  -   **Text**: Dark gray (`#4a4a4a`) for high readability without the harshness of pure black.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Card-Based Flow**: Quotes are presented as individual "cards" that float on the soft background.
  -   **Masonry Grid**: A non-linear layout that allows quotes of varying lengths to fit naturally, mimicking a pinboard.
  -   **Floating Action Buttons**: Primary actions (add quote, favorite) float above the surface, reinforcing the depth.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Soft Shadows**: The defining feature, used on buttons, cards, and inputs to create depth.
  -   **Inset Inputs**: Search bars and form fields appear pressed into the surface.
  -   **Rounded Everything**: Buttons, cards, and even icons have soft, rounded edges.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Press and Release**: Buttons should visually depress when clicked, providing immediate tactile feedback.
  -   **Smooth Toggles**: Switches and toggles slide effortlessly, like physical components.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Soft Easing**: Animations should be slow and smooth, avoiding sharp or sudden movements.
  -   **Elevation Changes**: Hover states should slightly lift elements, increasing the shadow spread.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headings**: *Nunito* (Rounded sans-serif) to complement the soft shapes.
  -   **Body**: *Lora* (Serif) for the quotes themselves, adding a touch of literary elegance.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style (International Typographic Style)
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Grid Systems**: A strict, mathematical grid to organize content and create visual order.
  2.  **Asymmetry**: Dynamic layouts that break symmetry to create tension and interest.
  3.  **Sans-Serif Typography**: Clean, objective typefaces that prioritize legibility and neutrality.
  4.  **High Contrast**: Bold use of black and white, with splashes of primary colors.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Base**: Stark white (`#ffffff`) for maximum clarity.
  -   **Text**: Pure black (`#000000`) for high contrast and impact.
  -   **Accent**: A vibrant, primary red (`#ff3b30`) used sparingly for emphasis and calls to action.
  -   **Secondary**: A cool gray (`#f5f5f7`) for subtle separation of sections.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Modular Grid**: Content is aligned to a rigid grid, but elements can span multiple columns or rows.
  -   **Whitespace as Structure**: Large areas of negative space are used to group and separate content, rather than lines or borders.
  -   **Typographic Hierarchy**: Size and weight of text define the structure, rather than boxes or containers.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Big Type**: Large, bold headings that serve as graphic elements.
  -   **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles or squares used as icons or decorative elements.
  -   **Lines**: Thin, precise lines to separate content or guide the eye.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Direct and Snappy**: Interactions are instant and precise, with no unnecessary flourishes.
  -   **Hover Reveals**: Additional information or actions appear on hover, keeping the initial view clean.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Linear Motion**: Movements are straight and direct, with minimal easing.
  -   **Staggered Reveals**: Content loads in a structured, sequential manner, emphasizing the grid.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headings**: *Helvetica Now Display* (or *Inter* Tight) – Bold, tight tracking.
  -   **Body**: *Inter* – Clean, neutral, highly legible.

  **Design Movement**: Glassmorphism (Frosted Glass)
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Translucency**: Elements have a frosted glass effect, allowing the background to blur through.
  2.  **Vivid Backgrounds**: A colorful, abstract background that provides depth and visual interest through the glass layers.
  3.  **Light Borders**: Subtle, semi-transparent white borders to define edges and simulate light catching the glass.
  4.  **Layering**: A strong sense of depth created by stacking glass layers on top of the background.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  -   **Background**: A rich, gradient mesh of deep purples (`#4c1d95`), pinks (`#db2777`), and blues (`#2563eb`).
  -   **Glass Layers**: White with low opacity (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`) and background blur (`backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`).
  -   **Text**: White (`#ffffff`) for readability against the dark, colorful background.
  -   **Accent**: A neon cyan (`#06b6d4`) for glowing highlights and active states.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  -   **Central Focus**: The main content area floats in the center, framed by the vibrant background.
  -   **Overlapping Elements**: Cards and sections may slightly overlap, emphasizing the transparency.
  -   **Fluid Containers**: Containers resize and adapt fluidly, like liquid in a glass vessel.

  **Signature Elements**:
  -   **Frosted Cards**: The primary container for quotes, with a blur effect and subtle border.
  -   **Glowing Orbs**: Abstract, glowing shapes in the background that move slowly.
  -   **Noise Texture**: A subtle grain overlay to add realism and reduce banding.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  -   **Glow Effects**: Hovering over elements causes them to glow or brighten, as if lit from within.
  -   **Parallax**: Background elements move at a different speed than foreground elements, enhancing depth.

  **Animation**:
  -   **Float and Drift**: Background elements drift slowly; cards float gently into place.
  -   **Blur Transitions**: Changes in state are accompanied by shifts in blur intensity.

  **Typography System**:
  -   **Headings**: *Outfit* – A geometric sans-serif that pairs well with modern, tech-forward aesthetics.
  -   **Body**: *Quicksand* – Rounded and friendly, softening the futuristic feel.
